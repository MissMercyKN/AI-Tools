AI tools and applications
Q1 What is TensorFlow and PyTorch?
These are both deep learning frameworks — tools that help you build, train, and test models that learn from data like humans do (sort of!).

They’re especially useful for:

Image recognition (like telling cats from dogs)

Speech recognition

Natural language processing (chatbots, translations)

Time-series prediction

And much more!

🧠 Think of them like this:
🛠️ TensorFlow
Created by Google

Like a professional lab: powerful, structured, and ready for big projects

Best for building models that go into production (like on apps or websites)

Has great support for mobile, web, and cloud deployment

Can be a bit harder to learn at the beginning

🔥 PyTorch
Created by Facebook

Like a creative workshop: very flexible and feels like normal Python

Best for learning, research, and experimentation

Easier for students and beginners

Most tutorials and university research projects use it

Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.
Answer:

🧪 Experimenting with AI code step-by-step
You can write and test your Python code in small chunks, see instant results, tweak it, and try again. Great for learning and debugging!

📊 Visualizing Data & Results
It allows you to insert graphs, charts, and markdown (text explanations) — making it easy to document your thought process alongside code.


Q3: 
What is spaCy?
spaCy is a powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) library in Python.
That means it helps computers understand and work with human language — like English, Kiswahili, etc.

🔍 So… what can spaCy do?
Instead of just seeing text as random words, spaCy helps you find meaning in it.

For example, if you have the sentence:

"Pauline lives in Nairobi and studies data science."

spaCy can tell you:

Who is mentioned? → Pauline (a person)

Where? → Nairobi (a location)

What is she doing? → studies data science (an action and topic)

What part of speech is each word? (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)


How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?
Answer:

Basic string functions (like .split(), .replace()) only deal with text at surface level — they don’t understand meaning.

spaCy goes deeper: it understands grammar, context, and structure using models trained on large amounts of language data.

Q4. Scikit learn vs Tensorflow
What is Scikit-learn?
Scikit-learn (also written as sklearn) is a machine learning library for classical ML — like:

Linear regression

Decision trees

K-means clustering

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

💡 It’s perfect when:

You want to analyze data.

You need quick and simple models.

You're working with structured data like Excel tables or CSVs.


What is TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is a deep learning library, mainly used to build neural networks — the type of models used for:

Image recognition 📷

Speech recognition 🎙️

Text translation 📚

Time-series forecasting 📈

💡 It’s perfect when:

You need to work with huge datasets.

You want to build advanced models like CNNs or RNNs.

You're doing deep learning
